# 🚀 TAQ-BOSTAN Project
### The most undetectable tunnel for bypassing censorship

---

Run the script using this command:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ParsaKSH/TAQ-BOSTAN/main/script.sh)
```

## 🌟 Project Introduction
The **TAQ-BOSTAN** project provides a comprehensive solution for creating secure internet tunnels and local IPv6 networks. It includes three main sections:

- [🔒 Creating a secure and fast tunnel with Hysteria2](#section-1-secure-and-fast-tunnel-with-hysteria2)
- [🌐 Creating local IPv6 using SIT](#section-2-create-local-ipv6-with-sit)
- [🛡 Creating local IPv6 using WireGuard](#section-3-create-local-ipv6-with-wireguard)

---

## 📌 Important Notes
- If your server doesn't have IPv6, first create local IPv6 using **SIT**. (Note: Do not use WireGuard-created local IPv6 for the Hysteria tunnel.)
- The scripts automate all installation and configuration steps for you.

### 📌 Advantages:
- Encrypted tunnel using **TLS 1.3 + QUIC**
- Transfers all traffic via a single UDP connection
- Completely prevents suspicion and detection from Iran Access
- Traffic behavior similar to regular HTTPS (no risk of detection)
- No need for a domain (uses self-signed SSL certificate)

### 🚀 Easy Installation:
Run the script on both Iranian and foreign servers.

- Simply answer the questions during the installation process to set up easily.

### 📌 Advantages:
- Extremely fast and lightweight (no extra encryption overhead)
- Native support by the Linux kernel
- Easy installation and configuration

**Running the script on Iranian server:**
- Choose server type as **IRAN**.
- Enter the Iranian server IP and the number of foreign servers.
- Enter the IP addresses of foreign servers one by one, then reboot the server.

**Running the script on foreign servers:**
- Choose server type as **FOREIGN**.
- Enter the foreign server IP and the Iranian server IP.
- Enter the foreign server number (as specified on the Iranian server).
- Reboot the server.
